<p>Whether you have naturally curly hair or are obsessed with your curling wand youll find a curly hairstyle you love among our favorite looks. Once youve done that you can trim a section at a time by holding the hair between your fingers sliding your fingers down to the desired length and cutting off the remaining hair. So learn from my mistake and DO NOT use regular scissors to cut hair unless you really know what youre doing. The self-cut clippers are suited for both home and professional use.
