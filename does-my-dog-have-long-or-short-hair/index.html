<p>Short-Haired dogs do not have a winter coat to they tend to shed more frequently and constantly than long-haired dogs. A small dog has less hair than a large one and if you keep that hair clipped short the volume of hair that falls out and onto your clothes and furniture will be minimal. For a long-haired dog you may want to ensure that it lives in hygienic conditions. Keep its ears clean and also clip the nails from time to time.
