<p>Curtain Bangs can completely transform a womans look. Bangs that are either swept to one side or parted down the middle in a curtain-like fashion conceal part of a round face for an instantly slimming effect. Shaggy cuts with bangs are making a comeback with heavy face-framing blended curtain bangs and wispy ends styled away from the face to add width to the hairstyle. Im predicting that curtain bangs or fringes will still be going strong as theres still plenty of people catching up to them says SalVersatile enough to be worn straight across your brows or split down the middle and swept off to either side like curtains theyre one of the easiest fringe styles to wear and the slightly longer length at the sides help to highlight.
