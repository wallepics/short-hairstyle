<p><strong>Why Do Redheads Age Faster</strong>, Unlike what that guy down there said they age slower not faster. The red hair results from a genetic mutation in Melanocortin 1 Receptor MC1R gene that encodes one of the most important proteins responsible for human hair color.

<p>As this color is not common a recessive trait both parents should have at least one copy of the mutated gene. That means that redheads can operate better in fight-or-flight situations which would definitely give them a better chance of survival. Simply put achromotrichia is the absence of pigment in the hair. 90 Day Fiancé star Jason Hitch has died from COVID-19 in a Florida hospital at the age of 45.</p>
