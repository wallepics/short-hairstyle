<p><strong>What Is Cut Slope</strong>, This Highway Slope Manual is a continuously updated version incorporating amendments issued since the Highway Slope Manual was published. AASHTO recommends that cut slopes steeper than 31 be evaluated with regard to. The orientation of the cut slope fixes the exposure of the slope to the sw1 and therefore affects the number of cycles of freezing and thaw ing and wetting and drying per year. The second technique utilizes green cuttings or branches from alder cottonwood or willow.</p>
