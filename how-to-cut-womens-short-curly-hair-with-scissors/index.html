<p>Some womens short hair styles look so fairy-like that it seems like theyve stepped out of a painting. This look is longer than what I consider a pixie cut but also not yet a bob. Being flattering and youthful this cut can also add. It is advisable to prefer a haircut with clear lines even a little sharp.
