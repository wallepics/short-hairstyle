<p>Using a good air-dry creme and manipulating damp hair how you want it to dry can encourage how you want your hair to lay. Fortunately there are ways to fix it though none are totally fool-proof. Once youve chopped your hair to pixie length there are all sorts of exciting new styles to put to the test. Use a strong hold volumizing hair spray like the LOréal Paris Elnett Satin Hairspray Extra Strong Hold Volume as a finishing touch then youre ready to turn heads and inspire future hairstyles with your messed-up pixie haircut.
