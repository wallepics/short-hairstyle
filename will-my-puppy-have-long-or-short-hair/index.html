<p>By 8 weeks a rough coated pup will be pretty much fluff and a medium will be fuzzy when compared to the shortsmooths. There is a definite and noticeable difference in head shape - almost Schauzer with ever so sligtly longercoarser hair around the nose. My boyfriend and I are adopting this pup from a local rescue. The ones who will have short fur as adults smooth coated will still have short shiny fur whereas thoe puppies who will have longer fur as adults rough coated will start having downier flyier fur.
