<p>Today were going to be talking about why curly hair is better than straight hair. Straight or curly is a trait that is written in the genetic code and the gene that is responsible for hair structure is called trichohyalin. For curly hair there are so many hair products that keep them smooth and moisturized and you can make use of natural serum or texturing spray. Unbeknownst to most people curly hair is a bit more difficult to maintain than the straight hair because it is drier than straight hair making it more liable to frizz.
