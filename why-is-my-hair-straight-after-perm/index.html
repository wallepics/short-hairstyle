<p>I am sorry to hear that your perm didnt take the way it normally does this is most likely caused by the change in products or the incorrect perm may have been used. In my experience with perms if youve wound it well with small sections left the lotion on until you get a good s shape forming and rinsed and neutralised well you cant make that hair straight again unless you use chemicals. Results will fade but your hair structure that it was applied to not the new growth is forever changed so adding more chemicals on top will at minimum skew results and at worst very seriously damage hair. The portions where the hair is wavy toward the top and straight at the bottom are clear indications that either there was too little waving lotion to fully penetrate the rolled hair to saturate all of it or that the hair was left on an insufficient amount of time.
