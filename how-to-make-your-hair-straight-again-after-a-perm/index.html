<p>Pull it taut so that it is perpendicular to your head. To straighten hair with a perm you have to apply a perm solution which helps maintain the same configuration. If your hair does not feel soft then use a deep conditioning shampoo and repeat the procedure until the hair is feeling softer and looser.

<p>Permed hair needs to be treated and cared for differently than non-permed hair. We have always shampooed immediately after a perm to remove the perm solution and any residual odor. With this you can manage to change the shape of your hair and give yourself a completely new look. Do not touch your hair after applying hair products.

<p>If you want you natural hair back avoid putting any other chemicals in it and just let it grow. In order to avoid that until you have only curlywavy hair on your head you can put your hair into a plait a loose bun or any other protective. Once the permanent waving solution has been neutralized from the hair your hair should be stable and safe to be permed as long as it has not been damaged. Do not touch your hair after applying hair products.
