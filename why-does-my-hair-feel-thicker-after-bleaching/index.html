<p>A hairdresser once to me said that bleach thickens your hair because of the damage it does to the hair. However keep in mind that this process occurs by roughing up the cuticle and too much beach processing can damage hair. The result is the illusion of thicker hair. There is a risk with bleaching however as it stresses your hair and breaks down its color pigmentsbut only if it is not properly done. Pin On Beauty.</p>
