<p>This is a very delicate part of the cut as you need to be very careful not to poke your dog with the scissors. Trimming the fur around your dogs eyes can be a bit tricky if you or your dog are feeling nervous or anxious. Dogs can see much better when fur is not covering their eyes and that makes life better for them. Use the very tip of the scissors to cut the fur on both sides of the bridge of the nose. 56pos91xc07ylm.</p>

<p>Top best answers to the question Should i cut the hair around my dogs eyes Answered by Chelsie Gaylord on Mon Jun 14 2021 833 PM Trimming the dogs hair which overhangs the eyes is necessary not only to allow the dog to have clearer vision but also to prevent this falling against the eye and causing irritation. Cutting hair around dogs eyes can be done at home with a little prep but only if your dog is relaxed and calm. No just like humans dogs cannot see through thick bangs. Of course extreme caution needs to be observed when trimming facial fur since the dog may be skittish and you can run the risk of injury.
