<p><strong>Should I Cut The Sides Of My Hair When Growing It Out</strong>, When growing out a lob long bob your hair should be long enough to create some cute braiding styles like a fishtail or a crown braid says Eden by Eden Sassoon stylist Katie BergenGo sleek. This may mean not touching the sides for a while and only cutting the fringe or leaving other parts of the hair shorter until it catches up. If a client does come to me with this request I usually advise them to go for a shorter haircut in order to catch up with the sides and start over with a more even base It might feel frustrating to want to grow out your hair and instead end up with shorter hair. To achieve the look.</p>

<p>Beanies and caps are you friend. Masuzi 23 mins ago Uncategorized Leave a comment 0 Views. Yeah lol mine is exactly the same i often have to wax the sides down depending on how i wear my hair my style normally depends on a few factors such as 1 bad hair day etc the way its flowing 2 length of time since last haircut 3 if ive washed with conditioner. Try parting your hair on the opposite side to hide the shaved side thats growing out.</p>
