<p><strong>What Solid Shape Has Rectangular Faces</strong>, A cuboid is also called a rectangular prism. A rectangular prism is a solid figure that has six sides called faces that are rectangles. A prism has a solid shape consisting of two identical ends such as triangle square rectangle etc flat faces or surfaces and uniform cross-section across its length. Some examples can be a book a piece of furniture or a jewelry box.</p>

<p>A cuboid is a solid three-dimensional object which has six faces that are rectangular in shape with eight vertices and twelve edgesSince the cuboid has six faces we can call it a regular hexahedron. Pentagon base is called a pentagonal pyramid. Triangular base is called a Tetrahedron. That is like a cube a cuboid has 6 faces 8 vertices and 12 edgesAlong with the rectangular cuboids any parallelepiped is a cuboid of this type as is a square frustum.</p>
