<p><strong>Why Do I Only Look Good With My Hair Up</strong>, They look better when most is tied back with 2 thin strands either side of the face 20 1156. Halli Bivona of the John Barrett Salon agrees. Wear your hair up may indeed generate traction on the face that could change the distribution of skin and fat. The best haircuts are softly layered low maintenance work with your natural texture and will look just as good in three months Hairstylist Jenna Mast told me.</p>

<p>Generally they look better with their hair down. The best haircuts are softly layered low maintenance work with your natural texture and will look just as good in three months Hairstylist Jenna Mast told me. I dont really know how to explain it any better than that but it. And stop putting yourself down.</p>

<p>Wear your hair up may indeed generate traction on the face that could change the distribution of skin and fat. I think a lot of girls look absolutely gorgeous in a bun but I hardly ever see it on a daily basis so its impossible to really say what is better. It always frizzes up or freaks out at an exact inopportune moment and whatever you do to it never seems to make it look any better. If you think you never will be then you wont be. But sometimes having it up can be much better.</p>

<p>I dont really know how to explain it any better than that but it. The amount of layers will depend on how thick or curly your hair is but gently framing your face is flattering. In a way it may give you an idea of a component of a facelift. HOWEVER advice for a nice style could be to curl it allput plaits in overnight so its all wavy so the ponytail itself will be pretty you could plait side bits of your hair and clip them up into the poytailtie them up with it and leave a little fringe bit hanging down to frame your face.

<p>So I think for my next haircut Im going to get some shorter layers so that the top of my head is more volumized and I get that half uphalf down effect. I dont really know how to explain it any better than that but it. For my own hair I figured out it probably looks good half updown because it adds volume to the top. Also if I dont straighten my hair Ill tie it up because my hair looks stupid when its down but not straightened. Great Tutorial Hair Styles Long Hair Styles Hair.</p>

<p>I think some loose faceframing pieces would soften the updo and make me like it more but hey thats just my personal taste. I think its hot when my fiance puts her hair in a high pony tail while she works out or when we are at the lake or something. However if you want to add more depth and dimension to your hair having more than one color is a must.

<p>But thick hair looks better when its long less triangular so Im leaving the overall length as it is. Attractiveness isnt measured on a scale of 1-10. That actually frustrated me a bit because I grew and am growing my hair to wear nice updos - my longer hair was rather pointless.

A good barber styles your hair with an eye toward how it will grow out so a good haircut is truly great a few weeks later. And stop putting yourself down. No matter your hair color if you go up a shade or two it will give the appearance of looking more youthful but the placement of highlights is key he explains.
