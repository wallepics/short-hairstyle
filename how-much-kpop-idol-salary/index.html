<p>Prince Mak says that an average rookie K-pop idol group earns about USD4000 per show more if overseas which is then broken down. Theyre only 2nd to BTS in income earned. To find out how much money Kpop idols make first you need to understand how income distribution works in Kpop. Yes that is right some Kpop Entertainment companies take 90 off the top and the Kpop artist gets 10. How Much Do K Pop Idols Earn Money In A Year Channel K.</p>

<p>There are many idols who have to work for years without getting paid because they have to pay for their training fees. SM Entertainment- 605 billion 5025 million YG Entertainment- 2843 billion. While in 2010 the average salary was 2264 million won approximately 20000 USD K-Pop idols average salary more than doubled to 4674 million won approximately 43000 USD by 2013 I know for bigger groups the money lies in concerts and such and I think a while back there was an article about some of the bigger companies about how they split different. Though the two did not disclose exactly how much they receive each month they explained that they would never be able to live properly if the company card did not exist.

<p>However that number can vary a lot depending on the status of the idol or group at hand. If the company were to release a music video for every track on the mini album it would be 450 million won. Lisas AIS endorsement in Thailand for instance is rumoured to be one of the richest around 17 million and she gets more than half of that. That pop up every now and then but from what I understand most idols barely make enough to live on.
