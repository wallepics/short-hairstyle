<p><strong>How To See What A Person With Glasses Sees</strong>, For this person when light enters the eye it is refracted more in one direction than the other allowing only part of the object to be in focus at one time. Look at the center one and try to notice what you see on either side of the center one without moving your eyes away from the center. But somebody with a color deficiency sees only a faint number or no number at all. This is illustrated by simulating the blurry perception of a Snellen eye chart which is commonly used to make eye examinations.</p>
