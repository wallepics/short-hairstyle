<p>The directions on the package say to apply toner to dry hair. I did not do the bleaching process this time around. Given their low-ammonia composition it also means theyre a healthy choice for your hair even if its damaged. This is what my hair looked like using JUST 20 developer plus T18 toner.

<p>Besides toners are safe for use as they act as a shield on your bleached hair. Its an acid-based product that tweaks and alters your hairs color shine and chemical composition. Through my personal experiences and with how thirsty my hair is I like to tone when it is slightly damp and towel dried. It needs to be completely bleached and stripped out of the hair and it wont be quick or easy. Pin On Pretty Hair.</p>
