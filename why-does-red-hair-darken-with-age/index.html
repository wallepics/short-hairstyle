<p><strong>Why Does Red Hair Darken With Age</strong>, Red hair is caused by producing phaeomelanin instead of black or brown eumelanin. Should you go darker or lighter with hair color as you age.

<p>It is a fact that blondes have softer hair than brunettes. Naturally blond hair tends to turn darker with age most fair-haired kids are no longer blonde when they reach their adult years. This means that a baby could be born a blonde or a redhead depending on the amount of pheomelanin but with age brown eumelanin starts to be expressed darkening the hair. As I understand it from a eumelanin perspective a redhead is a very light blond and as more eumelanin is added the red shifts auburn then to warm chestnuts and chocolates before hitting black.
