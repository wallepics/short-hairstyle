<p>Answer 1 of 4. The minimum length required depends on the size of the section the thickness of your hair and your hair type. You can cut the locs off or separate them into 2 thinner locs in order not putting too much tension on your scalp which leads to thinner root spots. The dreads will not get as large in diameter as they would if their were more hair but they will benefit from the fact that all hair that you shed remains in the dread.

<p>The dreads will not get as large in diameter as they would if their were more hair but they will benefit from the fact that all hair that you shed remains in the dread. You have control over the size of the dreads and how they form. Find a salon that does dread perms. The dreadlock will end up about 30 50 larger than the twist.
