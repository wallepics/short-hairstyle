<p><strong>Is One Length Hair Better Than Layers</strong>, Long layers are a great way to add some subtle shape to a lengthy head of hair without having to do a major chop. However if your hair is straight adding layers can often make the hair appear thinner and stringy. A one length cut is a hairstyle without layers meaning the hair is cut to a single and consistent length. And yes in my opinion theyre way better than one length.</p>

While a blunt cut can be startling for anyone the length of this chop will frame your face even better than your layers do and give you the thick one-length look you like. Layers can be a disservice to thin hair because taking away hair from the longest length can leave this section looking sparse and straggly.</p>

<p>This is especially true if. A simple one-length bob works incredibly well on thin or fine hair because it makes it look thicker and more voluminous overall. If you have thin hair that tends to be lifeless and dull or on the other hand if you have thick hair that gets weighed down then layers could be the perfect solution. Like Amaiaisabella said layers gave me body and all one length makes it fall flat around my face and not that flattering.

<p>Fine hair can only support a few layers or light layering. Long layering is perfect if you want an overt style but short layers are better for a more subtle shape hairstyle. If your hair is wavy or curly adding layers to the hair will allow the shorter layers to curl more and will let you style the hair to add volume and give the appearance of more hair. If you are looking for a shaped haircut which is as subtle as possible you should talk to your stylist so that they can create a short layered hairstyle that will meet your needs.
