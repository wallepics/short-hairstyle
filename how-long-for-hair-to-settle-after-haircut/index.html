<p><strong>How Long For Hair To Settle After Haircut</strong>, After a clean shave of a beard it takes only about 24 to 48 hours for stubble to start growing back. Take it from the side and roll toward the back of your head. After a bad haircut you can expect your hair to grow back at about this rate. If it would normally take you 4 weeks then go to visit your barber 8 weeks after to give the hair some more length to play with and blend in.</p>
