<p>Im living proof that this just isnt. One thing that you should know about shaving waxing epilating or lasering your hair off is that hair doesnt grow back thicker. So i say if you cut i dont know about shaving than your hair will still grow because like someone said above you cut your hair at the tip area while it wont do anything to the hair growing at the scalp. Growing out a bad haircut is the worst but growing out a good haircut is no walk in the park either.
