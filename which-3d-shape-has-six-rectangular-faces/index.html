<p><strong>Which 3d Shape Has Six Rectangular Faces</strong>, A cube or rectangular prism can also be called a hexahedron because it has six faces. In geometry a deltahedron plural deltahedra is a polyhedron whose faces are all equilateral triangles. A rectangular prism has 6 faces 8 vertices or corners and 12 edges. All angles are equal and right-angled triangles.</p>

<p>It therefore has 3 side faces plus the base and top or 5 in all. The difference between a cube and cuboid is that a cube has all edges equal which makes every face a square while a cuboid has two square faces and four rectangular faces. The name is taken from the Greek majuscule delta Δ which has the shape of an equilateral triangle. Which 3-D shape has six rectangular faces. According to Wikipedia the cube has has 11 nets which means there are 11 ways to flatten a hollow cube by cutting 7 edges.</p>
