<p>Bts have different coloured mics. RM Jimin Taehyung and Suga while members such as Jungkook Jin and Jhope are considered to have the healthiest hair simply because they rarely dye it a colour that requires it to be stripped with bleach which is what ruins hair in the process. Does bts choose their hair color. I am a sucker for guys with coloured hair so its definitely my preference in terms of seeing them perform on stage with colours of the rainbow.
