<p>In my opinion I think straight hair is quite boring and plain.

<p>Curly hair is thus an expression of 3 hair types wavy coiled and kinky and not a hair type by itself. So I would have some waves if I kept my hair short but if I grew it out very much there were no waves to be found. Tighter waves can create loose spirals or corkscrews but wont complete a full circle at the same height Since wavy hair is often so misunderstood it can be difficult to determine which strands are. In my opinion I think straight hair is quite boring and plain. Pin On Beauty Tips.</p>
