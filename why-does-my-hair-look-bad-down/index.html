<p><strong>Why Does My Hair Look Bad Down</strong>, This is compounded with the fact that my part isnt straightit goes back to the top of my head then nuts a crazy diagonal from the back of my ears to the back of my head that sounds crazy. I have a fairly deep side-part outer corner of my eye and getting my hair on the long side of my part to look good curled usually turns into a disaster. My mom tried to help but she didnt wear makeup and I didnt always listen to her about clothes. This could be due to miscommunication everyone has a different idea of what trim means or it could be that your stylist simply disregarded what you asked for.</p>

Ashley And longer hair does not always look thinner or flatter quite the opposite actually- it all depends on your hair texture-hair all one length is going to look thicker overall cutting layers just thins out the hair your basically chopping more hair off when you put layers in-i dont have layers my hair is all one length and looks thicker because of this if you want to make your hair look. This only makes you look older. So I think for my next haircut Im going to get some shorter layers so that the top of my head is more volumized and I get that half uphalf down effect.</p>
