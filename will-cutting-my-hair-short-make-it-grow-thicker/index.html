<p>However cutting hair short would not influence the hair growth rate or the health condition of the hair follicles. But I also know when you cut a kids hair multiple times so drastically it grows back thick which is why I dont want you cutting it all the way. Nevertheless getting a haircut will make it look like it is growing back shinier and thicker. By trimming unhealthy split ends your hair will have less breakage and flyaways making it look thicker and even shinier. Pin On Short Hair Models.</p>
